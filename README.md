# Project Todos

The aim of this project was to build a To-do project using Redux global state

## The problem

I first coded for the store - by building reducers - and then coded from there. There was a lot of nomenclature and syntax to implement, but I feel more confident with the flow and logic of Redux now. I also used UseState hook from React to store the input value from the User and local storage - using createStore Hook from reduxjs/toolkit - to store the inputs in the browser 
I actually really happy the clean aesthetc of my project and don't want to clutter it too much with adding too many more features.
